# michelob-demo
The purpose of this repository is to demo Svelte and Contentful by way of making a purely HTML/CSS page into a dynamic web page/site. 
I've chosen to recreate the home page of the Michelob Ultra site as if it were a flattened design mock. 
I've set the project up to where there are multiple branches, split into the stages of this project

The main branch is always the furthest along version of the project, and as I get to certain milestones, I will save a new branch. For instance, I'm currently working on the second step, but when I finished the first, I saved a new branch named "step-one".

Here are the steps that will be saved into branches.

1. step-one:
   - create a static HTML/CSS web page (using Michelob ULtra's current site for example)
2. step-two branch:
  -add svelte kit and refactor the static page into a svelte application with reusable compononets.
3. step-three branch:
  -install contentful, using the new library we will call our data to populate our components from step two and in turn have the data from contentful driving what we see in our components.
4. step-four:
   - creating new pages, pages as componenets
